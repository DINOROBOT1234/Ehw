<h2>Is the electric car really that eco-friendly</h2>
The electric car not only has advantages.
Everyone is talking about the advantage of an electric car that is said to be more environmentally friendly.
It can become a problem because the car's battery needs to be replaced every three to ten years.
Many rare materials such as lithium are used to make a car battery. The battery is very flammable and difficult to put out, so the whole car usually catches fire.
In addition, there is a new problem with disposal, what should you do with all the old car batteries?
Electricity would also run out if everyone drove an electric car.
Even the electricity would hardly be enough if everyone drove an electric car, at the moment not all electricity is generated in an environmentally friendly way.
For example, you have to drive an electric car more than 52,000 kilometers for the electric car to be really environmentally friendly again.
