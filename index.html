<span style="font-family:Comic Sans MS,cursive"><span style="font-size:16px">The electric car not only has advantages.<br />
Everyone is talking about the advantage of an electric car that is said to be more environmentally friendly.<br />
It can become a problem because the car&#39;s battery needs to be replaced every three to ten years.<br />
Many rare materials such as lithium are used to make a car battery. The battery is very flammable and difficult to put out, so the whole car usually catches fire.<br />
In addition, there is a new problem with disposal, what should you do with all the old car batteries?<br />
Electricity would also run out if everyone drove an electric car.<br />
Even the electricity would hardly be enough if everyone drove an electric car, at the moment not all electricity is generated in an environmentally friendly way.<br />
For example, you have to drive an electric car more than 52,000 kilometers for the electric car to be really environmentally friendly again.</span></span></p>
